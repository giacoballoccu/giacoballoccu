### Hi there 👋

I'm a PhD student at University of Cagliari (UniCa) and my research interest lay in Recommender Systems and end-user Explainability tecniques. I'm currently working on generating explanations based on Language Models outputs. Previously I mostly worked with Knowledge-Aware Recommender Systems and Path Reasoning methods. 

I'm teaching assistant of Algorithm and Data Structure in my University and I previously interned for 4 months at Amazon as Applied Scientist in the Targeting Science Ads team.

I train my models using Paperspace which gives you the chance to lease paying monthly subscription GPUs such as A100 80Gb, A6000 etc. Click [here](https://console.paperspace.com/signup?R=7H5U6TB) to get my referral and get 10$ of credit for free.
